This project is a Collaborative Online Judge (COJ) system, a web-based platform that enables multiple users to collaborate on coding problems in real-time to improve their skills and prepare for technical interviews. The following features were implemented:

- Utilized Angular and Bootstrap to build a responsive and interactive frontend for the web application.
- Employed Node.js and MongoDB for the server-side and database components of the application, respectively, creating a highly scalable and efficient backend that can handle large amounts of data and traffic.
- Incorporated Auth0 for secure user authentication and authorization.
- Implemented a collaborative code editor that supports multiple users editing simultaneously, utilizing ACE, Socket.io, and Redis to ensure robust and scalable functionality.
- Built a user-code executor service that utilizes Docker and Flask to enable seamless building and execution of user code.
